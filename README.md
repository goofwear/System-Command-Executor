A simple Library made to make the process of executing command lines through java programs simpler. It also returns the output line by line. Â 

```java
CommanBuilder builder = new CommanBuilder();
Executer executer = new Executer(new ExecuterStreamFormatter()/*implement to redirect the output your way*/);
try{
executer.execute(builder.forCommandLine("adb devices").withOptions(new String[]{"-l"}).build()); //this will execute "adb devices -l" command.
}catch(IOException e){
e.printStackTrace();
}
```
see the source code for detailed usage information.  

This library is the base of (Simple-ADB) program found here :
